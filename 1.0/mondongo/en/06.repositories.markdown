Repositories
============

The repositories perform **general functions of documents**.

They are obtained through the Mondongo, indicating the document's class from where you want to get the repository.

    [php]
    $articleRepository = $mondongo->getRepository('Model\Document\Article');
    $authorRepository  = $mondongo->getRepository('Model\Document\Author');

>[NOTE]
>The embedded documents don't have repositories.

Saving Documents
------------------

To save documents you can also use the method **_->save()_** of the
repositories, which is the one that uses internally the method _->save()_ of the documents.

    [php]
    // saving a document
    $articleRepository->save($article);

    // saving several documents
    $articleRepository->save(array($article1, $article2));

>[NOTE]
>To insert documents it is used the method
>[batchInsert](http://www.php.net/manual/en/mongocollection.batchinsert.php),
>and to update they use
>[atomic operations](http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Atomic+Operations),
>so both functions are done in a **very efficient** way.

There is also an **access from the Mondongo** indicating the class of the document.

    [php]
    // access from the Mondongo
    $mondongo->save('Model\Document\Article', $article);

>[TIP]
>Inserting documents from the repository is **very useful** when it has got to be
>inserted **several documents**. This way, all the operation is done in the same **batchInsert**.

Deleting Documents
------------------

To delete documents you can also use the method **_->delete()_** of the
repositories, which is the one that uses internally the method _->delete()_ of the
documents.

    [php]
    // deleting a document
    $articleRepository->delete($article);

    // deleting several documents
    $articleRepository->delete(array($article1, $article2));

    // access from the Mondongo
    $mondongo->delete('Model\Document\Article', array($article1, $article2));

>[NOTE]
>It is also very useful **to delete a lof of documents** from the repository, because
>it uses the operator
>[$in](http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Advanced+Queries#AdvancedQueries-%24in).

Connection
----------

You can get the **Mondongo connection** of the documents from the repository
through the method **_->getConnection()_**.

    [php]
    $connection = $articleRepository->getConnection();

Collection
----------

TYou can also obtain the **Mongo collection** to perform operations directly
with the method **_->getConnection()_**.

    [php]
    $collection = $articleRepository->getCollection();
