GridFS
======

With Mondongo you'll be able to store files in Mongo using
[GridFS](http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/GridFS) through objects
[MongoGridFS](http://php.net/manual/en/class.mongogridfs.php) of the PHP driver
very easily.

For it you have to map them as files.

    [php]
    array(
        'Model\Document\Image' => array(
            'is_file' => true,
            'fields' => array(
                'name' => 'string',
            ),
        ),
    );

When doing it the field **file** is automatically added, that is the one
in which the file is saved.

    [php]
    use Model\Document\Image;

    $image = new Image();

    // as file
    $image->setFile('/path/to/file');

    // as bytes
    $image->setFile(file_get_contents('/path/to/file'));

    $image->save();

>[CAUTION]
>The file **can't be updated**. The remaining mapped field can be updated.

And to retrieve them it is done the same way.

    [php]
    $image = $imageRepository->findOne();

    $image->getFile() // MongoGridFSFile

    $bytes = $image->getFile()->getBytes();
