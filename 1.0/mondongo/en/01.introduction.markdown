Introduction
============

**Mondongo** is a simple, poweful and ultrafast *Object Document Mapper*
(**ODM**) for **PHP** and **MongoDB**.

¿What is MongoDB?
----------------

**MongoDB** (*Mongo*) is a scalable, high-performance, open source, document-oriented database.

Mongo (and the [NOSQL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL) movement in general) answer to the
**needs for performance** of databases, that each time more applications
(especially **web**) have, due to the
**high number of reads, writes** and the high amount of information to store.

¿What is and ODM?
---------------

An **ODM** is a tool that **maps the structure** of the databases
**in objects** (PHP in this case). This way yoy can work in your documents
from the database with PHP objects, with all the great advantages that it carries.

An ODM also **abstracts** usual operations with the documents, and
provides with utilities that can simplify a lot common tasks.

An ODM also has a disadvantage: **the performance**. This is due to using
objects and abstracting operations.

¿Why an ODM with MongoDB?
--------------------------

Apparently the Mongo philosophy doesn't agree with the philosophy of ODM,
because on one hand Mongo speeds the database and on the other hand the ODM
slow down the applications. It's true, but we don't have to forget of the
**rapid application development**.

The *Rapid Application Development* **RAD**
is **very important** in order that your applications are running
**as soon as it is possible**, because it isn't worthwhile to spend a lot of time finishing a
superfast application if when it is going to be in production it can't compete or it's unmaintainable.

¿Why Mondongo?
------------------

>[SIDEBAR]
>Mondongo is to the **ODM** what Mongo is to **databases**.
>
>  * **Simple**: Mondongo is developed in a simple way. This makes it very easy to learn, use, and avoid bugs.
>  * **Powerful**: Mondongo is very flexible thanks to Mondator, so you'll be able to use it to develop any type of application.
>  * **Ultrafast**: Mondongo has been designed to be extremely light in memory consumption and processing cost.

¿Aren't you convinced yet? Let me show you a few more features:

  * **References and Embeds**: Mondongo allows you to work with [references and embeds](http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Schema+Design#SchemaDesign-Embedvs.Reference) very easily.
  * **Extensions**: Mondongo can be customized infinitely with Mondator Extensions.
  * **Indexes**: Mondongo allows you to work easily with the [indexes](http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Indexes) of the collections.
  * **Events**: Mondongo throws _hooks_ before and after inserting, updating, saving and deleting documents.
  * **GridFS**: Mondongo allows to save files of any size using [GridFS](http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/GridFS).
  * **Log**: Mondongo allows to save logs of the queries to improve the development.
  * **batchInsert**: Mondongo uses [batchInsert](http://www.php.net/manual/en/mongocollection.batchinsert.php) to insert documents in an efficient way.
  * **Atomic Operations**: Mondongo uses [atomic operations](http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Atomic+Operations) to update and delete documents efficiently.
  * **Integratión with IDEs**: Mondongo uses generated code, so you may integrate it with your IDE.
  * **Tested**: Mondongo is completely tested with automated test with [PHPUnit](http://www.phpunit.de).

>[NOTE]
>Mondongo is **the fastest mapper** in PHP **by far**.

Requirements
------------

### From your computer

Mondongo requires **PHP 5.3.0** or greater.

## From you

Mondongo uses [object oriented PHP](http://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.php)
and [Mongo](http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Tutorial), so if you want to start using it
you should know both things minimally at least .

Instalation
-----------

You can **install** Mondongo downloading it **directly**, by **git**, **svn** or
**PEAR**.

More information in the [Mondongo installation page](http://mondongo.es/installation).
