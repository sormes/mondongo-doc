Logging
=======

With Mondongo you can log the **queries that are sent to Mongo** to improve the development.

To do it you have to pass a **_PHP callable_** to the mondongo.

    [php]
    use Mondongo\Mondongo;

    $mondongo = new Mondongo();

    // anonymous function
    $mondongo->setLoggerCallable(function(array $log) { print($log); });

    // array
    $mondongo->setLoggerCallable(array($myLoggerObject, 'log'));

>[NOTE]
>This functionality doesn't have **any penalty in performance** in production,
>since when it's used it's done with Mongo collection objects
>special for logging, but when it's not used instead it's used the native ones.
