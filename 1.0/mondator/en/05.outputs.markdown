Outputs
=======

The outputs are used to indicate the output file of the classes and if they are overwritten or not.

    [php]
    use Mondongo\Mondator\Output\Output;

    // without overwriting
    $output = new Output('/path/to/my/project/Model/Document/Article.php');

    // overwriting (true as second argument)
    $output = new Output('/path/to/my/project/Model/Document/Base/Article.php', true);

>[NOTE]
>If it is overwritten or not depends if the user is going to customize
>the class, so the changes made are not lost.
