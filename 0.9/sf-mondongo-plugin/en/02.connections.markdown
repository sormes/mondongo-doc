Connections
==========

We can define Mondongo connections in the *databases.yml*:

    [yml]
    all:
      mondongo:
        class: sfMondongoDatabase
        param:
          server:   localhost
          database: my_database

If you have created the project without ORM (--orm=none) you have to enable
the use of databases in "sf_use_database" on settings.yml config file of
your apps.
