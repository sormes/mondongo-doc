Documents
==========

Mondongo documents are created like any other PHP object:

    [php]
    $article = new Article();

In Mondongo documents you can access to the data and modify them according to their definition.

Identifier
-------------

Accessing to the identifier **_id** of the Mongo documents is done in a different way from the rest of fields. It is simply used the **->getId()** function:

    [php]
    $article->getId();

Fields
------

Mondongo document fields can be accessed in several ways:

    [php]
    // directly (fastest)
    $article->get('title');

    // through __get (fast)
    $article->title;

    // through ArrayAccess (fast)
    $article['title'];

    // through __call (slow)
    $article->getTitle();

Fields are modified in the same way:

    [php]
    // directly (fastest)
    $article->set('title', 'Title');

    // through __set (fast)
    $article->title = 'Title';

    // through ArrayAccess (fast)
    $article['title'] = 'Title';

    // through __call (slow)
    $article->setTitle('Title');

To array:

    [php]
    $article->toArray();

From array:

    [php]
    $article->fromArray(array(
      'title'   => 'Title',
      'content' => 'Content',
    ));

References
-----------

References to one are assigned with the object or directly with the id:

    [php]
    // object
    $article['author'] = $author;

    // id
    $article['author_id'] = $author->getId();

It is accessed in the same way:

    [php]
    // object
    $author = $article['author'];

    // id
    $authorId = $article['author_id'];

References to many can be also assigned with objects or ids, but with objects we use a group of object to work more easily:

    [php]
    // group object
    $article['categories']->add($category1);
    $article['categories']->add($category2);

    $article['categories']->removeElement($category1);

    $article['categories']->setElements($categories);

    $article['categories']->clear();

    // id's
    $article['categories_ids'] = array(
      $category1->getId(),
      $category2->getId(),
    );

And it is accessed:

    [php]
    // group object
    $group = $article['categories'];

    // interface Countable
    $count = count($article['categories']);

    // interface IteratorAggregate
    foreach ($article['categories'] as $category)
    {
      // ...
    }

    // id's
    $ids = $article['categories_ids'];

Embeds
---------

Working with embeds is the same as with references, except that it is only by object because the don't have an id.

Relations
----------

Working with relations is the same as with references, and as is embeds only by object, and only for accessing, because they can't be assigned.

Clean Documents
---------------

The Mondongo documents are clean, so its are easily debuggables.

    [php]
    $article = new Article();
    $article->fromArray(array(
      'title'    => 'Mondongo',
      'content' => '1.0.0 Released',
    ));
    print_r($article);

    /*
    Article Object
    (
        [data:protected] => Array
            (
                [fields] => Array
                    (
                        [title] => Mondongo
                        [content] => 1.0.0 Released
                    )

            )

        [fieldsModified:protected] => Array
            (
                [title] =>
                [content] =>
            )

        [id:protected] =>
    )
    */
